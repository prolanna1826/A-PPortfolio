        <h2>Infectious Agents and Immunity</h2>
        <h3>Bacteria</h3>
        <p class="small"><strong>Structure:</strong> Prokaryotic cells, usually with peptidoglycan cell walls, that reproduce independently.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Examples:</strong> <em>Streptococcus</em> (strep throat), <em>E. coli</em> (UTI).</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Treatment / nursing relevance:</strong> Often treated with antibiotics. Monitor for allergies, side effects, C. diff risk, resistance, and reinforce full-course adherence. WBC/neutrophils may rise.</p>

        <h3>Viruses</h3>
        <p class="small"><strong>Structure:</strong> DNA or RNA in a protein coat (sometimes enveloped); requires host cells for replication.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Examples:</strong> Influenza, COVID, RSV.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Treatment / nursing relevance:</strong> Antibiotics do not treat viruses. Use supportive care, selected antivirals, vaccination, hydration, fever management, and infection-control teaching. Lymphocytes may be relatively elevated.</p>

        <h3>Fungus / Parasite</h3>
        <p class="small"><strong>Structure:</strong> Fungi are eukaryotes (yeasts/molds). Parasites are eukaryotic organisms living in or on hosts (protozoa/helminths).</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Examples:</strong> Candida, Aspergillus, Giardia, Plasmodium.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Treatment / nursing relevance:</strong> Requires antifungals or antiparasitics (not antibiotics). Watch for opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, dehydration, persistent symptoms, and exposure/travel history.</p>

        <h3>Difference Between Viral and Bacterial Infections</h3>
        <p class="small">Bacterial infections are caused by independently living cells and often respond to antibiotics. Viral infections require host cells, and antibiotics are ineffective. This distinction guides safe prescribing and prevents antibiotic resistance. Nurses combine clinical pattern recognition with diagnostics (cultures, PCR, antigen tests) to guide care.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Immune Cells Overview</h2>
        <ul class="small">
          <li><strong>Dendritic cell:</strong> Captures antigen, migrates to lymph nodes, and strongly activates T cells. Important for vaccine responses.</li>
          <li><strong>Mast cell:</strong> Releases histamine and mediators of allergy/inflammation; central in hives, bronchoconstriction, and anaphylaxis.</li>
          <li><strong>Macrophage:</strong> Tissue phagocyte that removes debris, presents antigen, and releases cytokines; important in inflammation and wound/infection control.</li>
          <li><strong>Microglia:</strong> CNS immune cells involved in neuroinflammation; emphasizes close neuro checks in suspected CNS infection.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Complement System</h2>
        <ul class="small">
          <li><strong>Classical pathway trigger:</strong> Antigen–antibody complexes (usually IgG/IgM).</li>
          <li><strong>Alternative pathway trigger:</strong> Direct pathogen surfaces (e.g., bacterial cell walls).</li>
          <li><strong>C3 activation (C3b) effects:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Opsonization:</strong> Coats pathogens for easier phagocytosis.</li>
              <li><strong>Cytolysis:</strong> Membrane attack complex forms pores and lyses targets.</li>
              <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Fragments such as C3a/C5a recruit cells and increase vascular permeability.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Fever and Inflammation</h2>
        <p class="small"><strong>Fever mechanism:</strong> Pyrogenic cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF) act on the hypothalamus to raise set point, which can slow pathogen growth and support immune efficiency.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Clinical note:</strong> Sustained fever above 104°F can cause dehydration, confusion, febrile seizures, and organ stress.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Nursing relevance:</strong> Trend temperature, hydration, mental status, and sepsis indicators. Fever can be protective early but dangerous if prolonged or severe.</p>
        <h3>Five Cardinal Signs of Inflammation</h3>
        <ol class="small">
          <li>Redness (rubor)</li>
          <li>Heat (calor)</li>
          <li>Swelling (tumor)</li>
          <li>Pain (dolor)</li>
          <li>Loss of function (functio laesa)</li>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Antigens, Antibodies, and MHC Molecules</h2>
        <p class="small">Antigens trigger immune responses; antibodies (from plasma cells) bind antigens and form immune complexes. These interactions explain vaccine protection, allergies, autoimmune disease, and transfusion reactions.</p>

        <h2>Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)</h2>
        <ul class="small">
          <li><strong>Macrophage:</strong> In tissues; phagocytosis, MHC II presentation, cytokine release. Important in infection cleanup and chronic inflammation (e.g., alveolar macrophages in pneumonia).</li>
          <li><strong>Dendritic cell:</strong> Skin/mucosa to lymph nodes; strongest APC for naive T-cell activation and vaccine response.</li>
          <li><strong>B cell:</strong> Blood/lymph organs; presents antigen via MHC II and differentiates into plasma cells that produce antibodies.</li>

          <li>Cytokines activate B cells and support CD8+ activation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="small"><strong>Nursing relevance:</strong> Low CD4 count/function (e.g., HIV) reduces coordination of both antibody and cytotoxic responses, increasing opportunistic infection risk.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Cytotoxic (CD8+) T Cell Activation Pathway</h2>
        <ol class="small">
          <li>Infected cell presents intracellular antigen on MHC I.</li>
          <li>CD8+ T-cell receptor recognizes antigen–MHC I.</li>
          <li>Activation triggers perforin and granzyme release.</li>
          <li>Target cell undergoes apoptosis/lysis, limiting pathogen spread.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="small"><strong>Nursing relevance:</strong> Cytotoxic T cells are critical for viral and cancer control; immunosuppressed patients have higher risk for severe viral reactivation and malignancy.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Guided Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1) How does understanding the immune system help early infection recognition?</h3>
        <p class="small">Immune-system knowledge supports early pattern recognition beyond isolated symptoms. Tracking inflammation signs, fever trends, tachycardia, and mental status changes helps identify evolving infection early. Linking labs to physiology (e.g., neutrophilia with many bacterial infections, relative lymphocyte increases in some viral illnesses) improves judgment. Understanding that dysregulated immune responses can rapidly progress to sepsis encourages early escalation of care.</p>

        <h3>2) Why understand bacterial vs viral infection before antibiotics?</h3>
        <p class="small">Antibiotics target bacterial structures/processes, not viruses. In viral illness, unnecessary antibiotics add risk (side effects, C. difficile, drug interactions, allergies) without benefit and accelerate resistance. Nursing practice depends on clear patient education, symptom validation, supportive-care guidance, and antibiotic stewardship.</p>

        <h3>3) How do vaccinations use immune memory?</h3>
        <p class="small">Vaccines provide a safe antigen exposure that activates APCs, helper T cells, B cells, and sometimes cytotoxic T cells. The key long-term outcome is formation of memory B and T cells. On future exposure, response is faster and stronger, lowering severe disease, hospitalization, and complications in vulnerable populations.</p>
