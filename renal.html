      <h1>Renal System</h1>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Major functions of the urinary system</p>
        <p>-Excretion of wastes and toxins</p>
        <p>Removes metabolic wastes like urea (protein metabolism), creatinine (muscle metabolism), and uric acid (nucleic acids). Helps eliminate many drugs and toxins (varies by drug clearance).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: rising BUN/creatinine suggests reduced filtration (AKI/CKD). Some toxins and meds accumulate when kidneys fail.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor renal labs, urine output trends, and adjust med timing/doses per renal function. Watch for nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, contrast, some antibiotics).</p>
        <p>-Regulation of water balance and blood volume</p>
        <p>Adjusts water excretion vs reabsorption to maintain blood volume and osmolarity.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: dehydration reduces renal perfusion → prerenal AKI risk; fluid overload contributes to edema/HTN/CHF worsening.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: strict I&amp;O, daily weights, assess edema, lung sounds, orthostatics, skin turgor, and urine concentration.</p>
        <p>-Electrolyte balance</p>
        <p>Fine-tunes Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, Ca²⁺, phosphate, and bicarbonate.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: kidney failure commonly causes hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Diuretics can cause hypokalemia or hyperkalemia depending on type.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: interpret BMP, watch ECG with K⁺ issues, monitor for muscle weakness/arrhythmias, and anticipate replacement protocols.</p>
        <p>-Acid–base homeostasis</p>
        <p>Regulates blood pH by controlling H⁺ secretion and HCO₃⁻ handling (reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate and generating new bicarbonate).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: CKD can cause chronic metabolic acidosis.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: watch ABGs/venous CO₂ (bicarb proxy), assess respiratory compensation patterns, and recognize symptoms (fatigue, confusion, tachypnea).</p>
        <p>-Endocrine functions</p>
        <p>--Renin initiates RAAS for blood pressure control.</p>
        <p>--Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates RBC production.</p>
        <p>--Activates vitamin D (calcitriol) for calcium absorption and bone health.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: CKD → anemia (low EPO) and renal bone disease (low calcitriol, phosphate retention).</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor Hgb/Hct, calcium/phosphate, educate on CKD complications, coordinate iron/EPO therapies when ordered.</p>
        <p>Key Concepts</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Water Balance and Kidney Function</h2>
        <p>A. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) - is the volume of filtrate formed by the kidneys per minute.</p>
        <p>Clinically estimated using eGFR (from creatinine + age/sex, etc.).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: GFR is the main marker used for CKD staging and kidney function trends.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: use eGFR/creatinine to anticipate medication dose adjustments and contrast precautions; track for AKI criteria along with urine output.</p>
        <p>Primary factor influencing GFR</p>
        <p>Net filtration pressure, mainly dependent on glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, which depends on renal perfusion/BP.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: hypotension, hemorrhage, dehydration, sepsis, or CHF can drop perfusion → decreased GFR.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: urine output is a “perfusion vital sign.” In adults, a common minimum target is around 0.5 mL/kg/hr (context-dependent).</p>
        <p>B. Mechanisms that alter GFR (three regulators)</p>
        <p>1) Autoregulation: Myogenic response</p>
        <p>The afferent arteriole constricts when stretched (high BP) and dilates when pressure drops (low BP).</p>
        <p>Purpose: stabilize GFR despite moderate BP changes.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: protects glomeruli from high pressure damage and maintains filtration during mild BP dips.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: severe hypotension overrides autoregulation → AKI risk; monitor MAP, mental status, skin perfusion, and urine output.</p>
        <p>2) Autoregulation: Tubuloglomerular feedback</p>
        <p>Macula densa senses NaCl flow in the distal tubule.</p>
        <p>High NaCl delivery (high GFR) → signals afferent constriction → lowers GFR.</p>
        <p>Low NaCl delivery (low GFR) → afferent dilation + renin release → raises GFR and activates RAAS.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: helps match filtration to tubular reabsorptive capacity.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: volume depletion and diuretics can trigger RAAS; monitor BP, orthostatics, electrolytes, and kidney labs.</p>
        <p>3) Sympathetic (neural/hormonal) control</p>
        <p>Stress states cause afferent arteriole constriction → GFR decreases to preserve BP and volume.</p>
        <p>Also increases renin release.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: shock can cause sharp drop in urine output early.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: recognize oliguria as a possible sign of shock, not just “kidney disease.” Escalate promptly.</p>
        <p>Where water is reabsorbed in the nephron</p>
        <p>1) Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)</p>
        <p>Reabsorbs the majority of filtered water (often described as roughly two-thirds).</p>
        <p>Water follows reabsorbed solutes (especially Na⁺).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: if the PCT is damaged (toxins, ischemia), reabsorption fails → volume/electrolyte problems.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: early AKI can present with rising creatinine and reduced urine output; assess nephrotoxin exposure.</p>
        <p>2) Nephron loop: descending limb</p>
        <p>Highly permeable to water, relatively impermeable to solutes.</p>
        <p>Water leaves tubular fluid into hypertonic medulla → tubular fluid becomes concentrated.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: descending limb helps establish the concentration gradient necessary for concentrating urine.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: dehydration states rely on this system plus ADH to conserve water.</p>
        <p>3) Nephron loop: ascending limb</p>
        <p>Impermeable to water, permeable to solutes (especially Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻).</p>
        <p>Solute leaves → tubular fluid becomes more dilute.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: this creates the medullary gradient (countercurrent multiplier).</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: loop diuretics target transport here → strong diuresis and electrolyte shifts.</p>
        <p>4) Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)</p>
        <p>Water reabsorption here is less than PCT and is more regulated depending on hormones and electrolyte needs.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: DCT is important for fine-tuning Na⁺/water balance.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: thiazide diuretics act here; monitor Na⁺, K⁺, BP, dehydration symptoms.</p>
        <p>5) Collecting duct</p>
        <p>Water permeability is strongly controlled by ADH.</p>
        <p>With ADH: water reabsorbed → concentrated urine.</p>
        <p>Without ADH: water stays in tubule → dilute urine.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: disorders like SIADH (too much ADH effect) or diabetes insipidus (too little ADH or kidney resistance) cause major water balance problems.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor serum sodium, urine specific gravity/osmolality, neuro symptoms (confusion/seizure risk with sodium shifts).</p>
        <p>Four major hormones and how each influences water balance:</p>
        <p>-ADH (antidiuretic hormone, vasopressin)</p>
        <p>Source: made in hypothalamus, released by posterior pituitary.</p>
        <p>Trigger: increased plasma osmolality, low blood volume/pressure, angiotensin II.</p>
        <p>Target/action: increases aquaporins in collecting ducts → increases water reabsorption.</p>
        <p>Net effect: decreases urine volume, increases urine concentration, increases blood volume.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: SIADH → water retention and hyponatremia; DI → large volumes of dilute urine and hypernatremia risk.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: frequent neuro checks with sodium abnormalities; monitor I&amp;O and daily weights; recognize very dilute vs very concentrated urine patterns.</p>
        <p>-Aldosterone</p>
        <p>Source: adrenal cortex (zona glomerulosa).</p>
        <p>Trigger: angiotensin II and high serum K⁺.</p>
        <p>Target/action: acts on DCT and collecting duct to increase Na⁺ reabsorption and increase K⁺ (and H⁺) secretion.</p>
        <p>Net effect: water follows sodium → increases blood volume and BP; lowers K⁺; can promote metabolic alkalosis.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: hyperaldosteronism → hypertension + hypokalemia; aldosterone blockers can cause hyperkalemia.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor K⁺ and BP closely, especially with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, spironolactone.</p>
        <p>-ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide)</p>
        <p>Source: atrial cardiac muscle cells.</p>
        <p>Trigger: atrial stretch from increased blood volume.</p>
        <p>Target/action: promotes Na⁺ and water excretion; inhibits renin/aldosterone/ADH; can increase GFR.</p>
        <p>Net effect: decreases blood volume and BP.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: protective mechanism during fluid overload, but may be insufficient in CHF.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: recognize volume overload signs, monitor response to diuresis and fluid restrictions.</p>
        <p>-Renin / Angiotensin II (RAAS control)</p>
        <p>Source: renin from JG cells; angiotensin II produced via renin + ACE pathway.</p>
        <p>Trigger: low perfusion/low NaCl delivery/sympathetic stimulation.</p>
        <p>Target/action: vasoconstriction + aldosterone + ADH + thirst.</p>
        <p>Net effect: increases BP and water retention.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: renal artery stenosis can activate RAAS and worsen HTN.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: ACE inhibitors/ARBs can increase K⁺ and affect creatinine early; monitor labs and BP after starting.</p>
        <p>The nephron is the functional filtration unit of the kidney.</p>
        <p>1) Glomerulus</p>
        <p>What it is: a tuft of fenestrated capillaries inside the renal corpuscle.</p>
        <p>Main job: filtration of plasma into Bowman’s space.</p>
        <p>-Lets water and small solutes pass (Na⁺, glucose, urea, amino acids).</p>
        <p>-Keeps RBCs and most proteins in the blood via the filtration barrier (endothelium, basement membrane, podocytes).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance:</p>
        <p>Proteinuria suggests glomerular barrier damage (diabetic nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome).</p>
        <p>Hematuria with RBC casts suggests glomerulonephritis.</p>
        <p>High systemic pressure over time damages glomeruli.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection:</p>
        <p>Check urine for protein/blood, monitor edema, BP, and creatinine trends.</p>
        <p>Teach diabetic patients that glucose control protects glomeruli long-term.</p>
        <p>2) Bowman’s capsule</p>
        <p>What it is: a cup-like structure surrounding the glomerulus.</p>
        <p>Main job: collects the filtrate in the capsular space, then directs it into the PCT.</p>
        <p>-The glomerulus + Bowman’s capsule together form the renal corpuscle, the “filtration start point.”</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance:</p>
        <p>Filtrate entering Bowman’s space should be essentially protein-free. Persistent protein points to filtration barrier disease.</p>
        <p>Reduced filtration leads to decreased filtrate formation and rising wastes.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection:</p>
        <p>Low urine output plus rising creatinine is a red flag for reduced filtration.</p>
        <p>Track and report oliguria early, especially post-op, septic, or hypotensive patients.</p>
        <p>3) Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)</p>
        <p>What it is: first tubule segment after Bowman’s capsule.</p>
        <p>Main job: bulk reabsorption (the “workhorse” of reabsorption).</p>
        <p>Reabsorbs most of the filtered load:</p>
        <p>-Water and Na⁺ (large majority)</p>
        <p>-Glucose and amino acids (normally nearly all)</p>
        <p>-Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) (major acid–base role)</p>
        <p>-Also secretes some substances into tubular fluid (H⁺, drugs, toxins).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance:</p>
        <p>Glucosuria happens when transporters are overwhelmed (diabetes) or blocked (SGLT2 meds).</p>
        <p>PCT injury is common in acute tubular necrosis (ischemia, nephrotoxins).</p>
        <p>Loss of bicarbonate handling can contribute to metabolic acidosis.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection:</p>
        <p>Monitor for nephrotoxin exposure (contrast, aminoglycosides, NSAIDs).</p>
        <p>Understand why SGLT2 inhibitors increase urine glucose and can increase UTI/yeast risk.</p>
        <p>In AKI: monitor UO, creatinine, electrolytes, and medication dosing.</p>
        <p>4) Loop of Henle (descending and ascending limbs)</p>
        <p>Big purpose: creates the medullary gradient so the kidney can concentrate urine.</p>
        <p>-Descending limb</p>
        <p>Main job: water reabsorption.</p>
        <p>Permeable to water, relatively less permeable to solutes.</p>
        <p>Tubular fluid becomes more concentrated as it goes down.</p>
        <p>-Ascending limb</p>
        <p>Main job: solute reabsorption.</p>
        <p>Impermeable to water, reabsorbs solutes (Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻).</p>
        <p>Tubular fluid becomes more dilute as it goes up.</p>
        <p>This is where the “salt gradient” in the medulla gets built.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance:</p>
        <p>Loop diuretics act on the thick ascending limb (inhibit Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ transport) → strong diuresis.</p>
        <p>Disrupting the loop reduces the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection:</p>
        <p>With loop diuretics: monitor for dehydration, hypotension, hypokalemia, low magnesium, and kidney function changes.</p>
        <p>For patients with edema/CHF: track daily weights, lung sounds, urine output response.</p>
        <p>5) Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)</p>
        <p>Main job: fine-tuning electrolytes and contributing to acid–base balance.</p>
        <p>-Reabsorbs NaCl (less than PCT, but important for control).</p>
        <p>-Handles calcium reabsorption (influenced by PTH).</p>
        <p>-Aldosterone influences later distal segments, but the DCT is part of the “fine regulation zone.”</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance:</p>
        <p>Thiazide diuretics act here → can lower BP and increase Ca²⁺ reabsorption.</p>
        <p>Can cause hyponatremia and hypokalemia in some patients.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection:</p>
        <p>Monitor Na⁺, K⁺, BP, and symptoms of dizziness/orthostasis.</p>
        <p>Know thiazides can help reduce kidney stone recurrence in some calcium stone formers (by reducing urinary calcium).</p>
        <p>6) Collecting duct</p>
        <p>Main job: final control of urine concentration and final electrolyte adjustments.</p>
        <p>-ADH controls water permeability (aquaporins).</p>
        <p>--With ADH: more water reabsorbed → concentrated urine.</p>
        <p>--Without ADH: less water reabsorbed → dilute urine.</p>
        <p>-Aldosterone affects Na⁺ reabsorption and K⁺ secretion in late distal/collecting areas.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance:</p>
        <p>SIADH: too much ADH effect → water retention, dilutional hyponatremia.</p>
        <p>Diabetes insipidus: too little ADH effect or renal resistance → huge dilute urine output, dehydration, hypernatremia risk.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection:</p>
        <p>Monitor urine specific gravity and serum sodium trends.</p>
        <p>Neuro checks are important when sodium is abnormal (confusion, seizures).</p>
        <p>Teach fluid restriction or medication adherence depending on disorder.</p>
        <p>Blood stays in vessels (arterioles/capillaries/veins).</p>
        <p>Filtrate is the fluid that has crossed from glomerular capillaries into Bowman’s space (basically plasma without cells and most proteins).</p>
        <p>Tubular fluid is filtrate after it enters the tubules and gets modified by reabsorption/secretion.</p>
        <p>Urine is the final fluid after collecting duct processing, leaving the papilla into calyces.</p>
        <p>Filtration and urine formation steps:</p>
        <p>Step 1: Afferent arteriole → glomerulus</p>
        <p>Process: filtration pressure forces water and small solutes out of glomerular capillaries.</p>
        <p>Fluid context: still blood in the vessels, but filtration is happening across the membrane.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: afferent constriction lowers GFR; efferent changes alter glomerular pressure.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: hypotension, shock, and vasoconstrictors can reduce renal perfusion.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Bowman’s capsule (capsular space)</p>
        <p>Process: collects freshly filtered fluid.</p>
        <p>Fluid name: glomerular filtrate.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: protein should generally not be here in significant amounts; proteinuria suggests barrier damage.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: urine protein can hint at kidney damage before severe GFR decline.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)</p>
        <p>Process: bulk reabsorption of water, Na⁺, glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate; secretion of some wastes/drugs.</p>
        <p>Fluid name: tubular fluid (filtrate being modified).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: glucose in urine can occur when blood glucose exceeds reabsorptive capacity (diabetes).</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: assess for polyuria/polydipsia patterns, monitor diabetic control, understand why SGLT2 inhibitors cause glucosuria.</p>
        <p>Step 4: Nephron loop (Loop of Henle)</p>
        <p>Process: Descending limb: water out → fluid concentrates.</p>
        <p>Ascending limb: solute out, water stays → fluid dilutes and medullary gradient is built.</p>
        <p>Fluid name: still tubular fluid.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: loop diuretics disrupt salt reabsorption → reduced concentrating ability.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor for dehydration, hypotension, hypokalemia, and ototoxicity risk with high-dose loop diuretics.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)</p>
        <p>Process: fine-tunes electrolytes; responds to aldosterone and other signals.</p>
        <p>Fluid name: tubular fluid.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: thiazides act here, often used for HTN.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: watch Na⁺ and K⁺, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension.</p>
        <p>Step 6: Collecting duct → papillary duct</p>
        <p>Process: final concentration/dilution of urine; ADH controls water reabsorption; aldosterone affects Na⁺/K⁺ handling.</p>
        <p>Fluid name: becomes urine as it leaves the papillary ducts.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: DI or SIADH is basically collecting-duct water regulation dysfunction.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: assess urine specific gravity, serum sodium, neuro status.</p>
        <p>Step 7: Minor calyx → major calyx → renal pelvis → ureter → bladder → urethra</p>
        <p>Process: transport and storage, no major chemical modification (mainly conduction).</p>
        <p>Fluid name: urine throughout this pathway.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: obstruction (stone, tumor, BPH) backs up urine → hydronephrosis → kidney damage.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor for flank pain, hematuria, urinary retention, decreased output, and infection signs.</p>
        <p>The kidneys regulate pH by controlling hydrogen ions (H⁺) and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻).</p>
        <p>-Main renal strategies</p>
        <p>1) Reabsorb filtered bicarbonate</p>
        <p>Prevents loss of HCO₃⁻ (a major base buffer).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: losing bicarbonate worsens acidosis.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: low bicarbonate on BMP can reflect metabolic acidosis; monitor trends.</p>
        <p>2) Secrete hydrogen ions into the tubules</p>
        <p>Removes acid from the body via urine.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: in renal failure, H⁺ excretion drops → acidosis.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: watch for compensatory tachypnea (blowing off CO₂).</p>
        <p>3) Generate new bicarbonate (especially via ammonium buffering)</p>
        <p>Kidneys create NH₄⁺ to trap and excrete acid while replenishing HCO₃⁻.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: chronic kidney disease reduces this ability → persistent metabolic acidosis.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: CKD patients may need bicarbonate therapy; monitor sodium load and volume status if given.</p>
        <p>-How kidneys work with the respiratory system to maintain acid–base balance (bicarbonate link)</p>
        <p>Lungs control CO₂ (fast). CO₂ acts like an acid (carbonic acid).</p>
        <p>Kidneys control HCO₃⁻ and H⁺ (slow - hours to days).</p>
        <p>Together they regulate the bicarbonate buffer system:</p>
        <p>CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃ ⇌ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻</p>
        <p>Acid–base disorder definitions:</p>
        <p>-Respiratory acidosis</p>
        <p>Primary issue: CO₂ retention from hypoventilation, pH decreases.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: assess airway, ventilation, opioid/sedative effects, COPD exacerbation management.</p>
        <p>-Respiratory alkalosis</p>
        <p>Primary issue: CO₂ loss from hyperventilation, pH increases.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: manage pain/anxiety, evaluate sepsis/fever, check ventilator settings.</p>
        <p>-Metabolic acidosis</p>
        <p>Primary issue: low HCO₃⁻ or excess acids, pH decreases.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: DKA, lactic acidosis, diarrhea, renal failure assessment; monitor K⁺ closely.</p>
        <p>-Metabolic alkalosis</p>
        <p>Primary issue: high HCO₃⁻ or acid loss, pH increases.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: vomiting/NG suction, diuretics, electrolyte replacement (K⁺/Cl⁻).</p>
        <p>Quick interpretation aid (ROME)</p>
        <p>Respiratory: pH and CO₂ move opposite directions.</p>
        <p>Metabolic: pH and HCO₃⁻ move in the same direction.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: this supports fast bedside ABG interpretation and escalation.</p>
        <p>Stimulus for renin release</p>
        <p>Low renal perfusion pressure (low BP/low volume)</p>
        <p>Low NaCl delivery to macula densa</p>
        <p>Sympathetic stimulation (β1)</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: prerenal states trigger RAAS. Assess hydration, hemorrhage, sepsis, CHF.</p>
        <p>Sequence of events:</p>
        <p>-Renin released by juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in afferent arteriole.</p>
        <p>-Renin converts angiotensinogen (liver) to angiotensin I.</p>
        <p>-ACE (mostly lungs) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II.</p>
        <p>-Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and stimulates aldosterone (and also ADH and thirst).</p>
        <p>-Aldosterone acts on DCT and collecting duct to increase Na⁺ reabsorption and increase K⁺ secretion (water follows sodium).</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: ACE inhibitors/ARBs reduce BP and protect kidneys in diabetes but may raise K⁺ and creatinine initially.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor BP, K⁺, creatinine after starting; teach patients about dehydration risks and when to call provider.</p>

        <h2>9. Hormonal Fluid Regulation Summary</h2>
        <p>-ADH</p>
        <p>Triggered by increased osmolality or low volume/pressure.</p>
        <p>Makes collecting ducts more water-permeable via aquaporins.</p>
        <p>Net effect is water retention, concentrated urine, increased blood volume.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: SIADH vs DI recognition using sodium + urine concentration.</p>
        <p>-ANP</p>
        <p>Triggered by atrial stretch from high volume.</p>
        <p>Promotes sodium and water loss, suppresses RAAS and ADH.</p>
        <p>Net effect is decreased blood volume and BP.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: supportive in volume overload but may be insufficient in CHF.</p>
        <p>-Aldosterone</p>
        <p>Triggered by angiotensin II and high K⁺.</p>
        <p>Increases Na⁺ reabsorption and K⁺ secretion in distal nephron.</p>
        <p>Net effect is increased volume/BP, decreased potassium.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor electrolytes, especially with diuretics and RAAS meds.</p>
        <p>-Renin</p>
        <p>Triggered by low perfusion/low NaCl/sympathetic input.</p>
        <p>Starts RAAS cascade, increasing angiotensin II and aldosterone.</p>
        <p>Net effect is increased BP and water retention.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: interpret renin’s role in hypotension states and chronic HTN.</p>

        <h2>10. Water Movement</h2>
        <p>Water moves by osmosis across membranes from lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: IV fluids alter osmolarity and shift water between compartments.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: choose fluids appropriately (isotonic for volume, cautious with hypotonic/hypertonic depending on sodium and neuro status).</p>
        <p>Water follows sodium (Na⁺) because sodium is the main determinant of extracellular osmolarity.</p>
        <p>Clinical relevance: abnormal Na⁺ causes dangerous water shifts in the brain.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: slow correction rules exist for sodium disorders to prevent neurologic injury.</p>

        <h2>11. Review Questions</h2>
        <p>1) What is GFR and how is it primarily regulated?</p>
        <p>GFR is the volume of filtrate formed per minute by the kidneys, mainly regulated by renal perfusion and net filtration pressure, stabilized by autoregulation (myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback) and modified in stress states by sympathetic control and hormones (RAAS and ANP).</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor urine output and renal labs after hypotension, dehydration, surgery, or nephrotoxin exposure.</p>
        <p>2) Compare the three mechanisms that control GFR</p>
        <p>Myogenic response adjusts afferent tone based on stretch.</p>
        <p>Tubuloglomerular feedback uses macula densa NaCl sensing to adjust afferent tone and renin release.</p>
        <p>Sympathetic control constricts afferent arteriole during stress to conserve volume and BP.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: oliguria can signal perfusion failure, not just “kidney disease.”</p>
        <p>3) Where in the nephron is most water reabsorbed?</p>
        <p>Most water reabsorption occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: understand why patients can still become volume depleted fast with diuretics, because downstream segments can strongly alter final water loss.</p>
        <p>4) How do ADH and aldosterone differ in kidney effects?</p>
        <p>ADH directly controls water permeability in the collecting duct, while aldosterone controls sodium reabsorption (and potassium secretion) in distal nephron segments, with water following sodium.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: ADH issues often show as abnormal urine concentration and sodium dilution/concentration; aldosterone issues often show as BP changes and potassium shifts.</p>
        <p>5) Describe the RAAS pathway in detail</p>
        <p>Low perfusion/low NaCl/sympathetic stimulation triggers renin release, converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which ACE converts to angiotensin II; angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and stimulates aldosterone and ADH, increasing sodium and water retention to raise BP and volume.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: monitor BP, K⁺, and renal labs with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists.</p>
        <p>6) How does the renal system correct metabolic acidosis?</p>
        <p>It secretes H⁺, reabsorbs filtered bicarbonate, and generates new bicarbonate (often via ammonium buffering), which removes acid and restores base to normalize pH.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: CKD reduces this ability leading to chronic acidosis; monitor bicarbonate and respiratory compensation.</p>
        <p>7) What is the path of filtrate from glomerulus to urethra?</p>
        <p>Glomerulus → Bowman’s space → PCT → nephron loop → DCT → collecting duct → papillary duct → minor calyx → major calyx → renal pelvis → ureter → bladder → urethra.</p>
        <p>Nursing connection: obstruction anywhere can cause hydronephrosis and AKI; monitor pain, output, retention, infection.</p>
